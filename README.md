# Mining amulets in Racket

This is some code I cooked up over the weekend for mining [amulets][1] in Racket. I’ve made an
effort to comment it well enough to understand, but you would also do well to read the documentation
for the libraries it uses: [enumerations][2] and [places][3].

You are free to use modify this code however you want, for any purpose; but [you must give
credit][4] to this software and each contributor, for contributing to goods or services that you
develop with the help of this software. (See [the short, readable license][4] for details.)

This means (among other things) that if you mint any NFTs that you find with the help of this code,
you must give credit to this software. If using Zora, give credit within the `description` field of
your NFT’s metadata.
